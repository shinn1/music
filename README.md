## Data
- `amplitude.csv` contains sound amplitudes of music at a 150-ms interval
- `survey.csv` contains survey data

## Joint behavior
- `recurrence_together.py` computes recurrence metrics for music created by pairs
- `shuffle_rec_together.py` performs permutation test on the observed recurrence metrics

## Pairwise behavior
- `recurrence_pair.py` computes mutual information and transfer entropy
- `shuffle_rec_pair.py` performs permutation test on the observed mutual information and transfer entropy

## Relationship with individual attributes
- `analysis_MI_traits.r` runs GLM on mutual information
- `analysis_TE_traits.r` runs GLM on transfer entropy
